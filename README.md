# Mentor-Minutes
Short video interviews with people in (or entering) cybersecurity in which they share the wisdom they've gleaned, the experiences they've had, etc.


## Motivation
Whatever your feelings on the Boy Scouts of America program, it was fantastic for me both as a scout and as a scoutmaster. Besides all the adventures, some of the most memorable experiences for me are various "Scoutmaster's Minutes," breaks at the end of a day of hiking, service projects, etc. where scoutmasters gather the kids around to impart some wisdom or reflect on where we've arrived. In so many environments I see more management than leadership, and I hope to effect greater positive change by giving more people greater voices.

Here is how it works: I interview you (audio or video) and seek your advice for people in cybersecurity, either those approaching your role, those facing workplace challenges, working through constraints, etc.. The whole thing takes less than 15 minutes of your time and the finished cut will be five minutes or less. You get full control over what stays in and what gets cut and you are welcome to reshare the finished piece however you like. If you have a topic that really warrants more than five minutes, let's plan it out.

## How it works:

### You retain control, always
- If you don't like how the finished video turns out, I won't publish and won't even keep the footage
- If you change your mind and want to take down published videos, I will take them down
- We can start fresh or iterate however you like

### Workflow
1. Share in advance anything you want me to know or ask (see some [inspiration below](#Example-things-to-share)).
    - If you don't have specifics you want to cover, I'll ask you some [standard questions](#Example-standard-questions).

1. Let me know what format you want:
    - Just record five straight minutes (no retakes)
    - Record more time that I'll cut down to less than five (allows retakes)
1. Draft up anything you want me to know or ask
    - Optionally draft up responses if you like
1. We record, in-person or over Zoom
    - We can record more than five minutes and I'll trim it down, but I think recording up to five straight minutes is a great format and is more engaging to the audience. 
1. I'll trim and/or edit to fit the five-minute format, and send to you for approval
    a. I'll make any changes your recommend and we can rerecord or add parts if you like
    b. You review again until you like it
1. I'll publish on LinkedIn and on YouTube - you are welcome to share there or on other platforms
    - Optional: If you like, I'll link to your profiles or anything else you like (charities, projects, etc.) and give you a mention. 

Example things to share:
- New to cybersecurity or been around?
- What would you like a future interviewer to discuss?
- Current role
- Favorite role
- Hardest role
- Biggest/favorite hobby

Example standard questions:
- What do you love most about your role/the cybersecurity field/your past 12 months/etc.?
- What would you change if you had complete oversight to do it?
- What was your role before this, and how did you make the transition?
- What trends are you seeing in the workplace for security practitioners?
- How did you get your start in security?
- What first drew you to cybersecurity?
- What has been the most fun class, course, certification you've completed?
- What advice do you have for people trying to land their first security role coming from a non-IT field?
- What volunteering are you doing?
- Where can people find you online?
